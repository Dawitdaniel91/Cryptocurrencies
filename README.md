# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is by using  unsupervised learning skills to create an analysis for the clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. The unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. .

The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies and create a report including the traded cryptocurrencies classified by group according to their features.

This classification report could be used by an investment bank to propose a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its clients.

During the analysis the following method is used:

  . preprocessing the database,
  
  . reducing the data dimension using Principal Component Analysis,
  
  . clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means,
  
  . visualizing classification results with 2D and 3D scatter plots.
